The python file contains the code for an interactive quiz that uses a survey dataset to calculate associations between age, preferred music genre, and mental health. 
# Data
The dataset used to inform the analysis conducted by the interactive is sourced from [Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). The data comes from a comprehensive survey containing far more information than is relevant for this questionnaire. For this project, I used the columns titled "Age", "Fav genre", "Anxiety", "Depression", "Insomnia", and "OCD".
